        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a
        web page and its content. For example, content could be structured
        within a set of parapgraphs, a list of bulated points, or using images
        and data tables. At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements,
        which can be applied to pieces of test to give time different meaning in
        a document, structure a document into logical sections, and embedcontent
        such as images and videos into a page.
      </p>
      <p>Element consist of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A tag name</li>
        <li>Required or optional attributes</li>
      </ul>

        CSS is the acronym of "Cascading style sheets". CSS is a computer
        language for laying out and structuring web pages (HTML or XML). This
        language contains coding elements and is composed of these "cascading
        style sheets" which are equally called CSS files (. css). It can be used
        for very basic document text styling, creates layouts, and even create
        effects like animations.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS is a rule based language --- you define the rules by specifying
        groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you can decide to have the main heading on your page to be
        shown as a large red text.
      </p>
      <p>The following code shows CSS that would create the effect above:</p>
      <img src="css.png" />
      <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
